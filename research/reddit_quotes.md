> "Like I know I liked and saved the topic alot but it’s getting repetitive and not interested anymore so just tap not interested and that same specific topic keeps appearing in my feed and search feed like bruh am I supposed to or do I keep pressing not interested"

> “I've never really used any part of Instagram's discovery functions. Years ago I used to look at the people I followed, which were only people I know irl. Last few years I almost haven't used instagram at all.
For whatever reason, if I do end up switching to the search section, pretty much every single post that shows up there is of half-naked girls. Since I'm in a long term relationship I figured I'd do something about it to limit the risk that my partner would find anything to worry about.
So I started scrolling through insta, pretty much the first time in my life, and clicking not interested on every sexual or thirsty post. I've now scrolled for hours and clicked not interested on hundreds of posts. Despite this, I can still scroll through more than 10 thirst trap posts in a row uninterrupted.
I don't get it. Why does instagram insist so vehemently on showing me this type of content despite the vast majority of my all-time usage consisting of me doing nothing but clicking not interested on it?”
